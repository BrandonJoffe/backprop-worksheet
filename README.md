# Backprop-worksheet: A reference

The pdf document in this repo serves as a reference for students, engineers and researchers who occasionally need to work through the analytical computation of gradients and backpropagation update calculations. The document is an ongoing effort and there may be errors. As soon as github properly supports latex we will move everything to use markdown formatting in this readme. Please feel free to send pull requests with new layers or corrections.
